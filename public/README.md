### Contact and general information
- You are welcome to come and join us at our [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#porq-pine:matrix.org)!
- You can also watch a [video demo of the OS here](https://github.com/PorQ-Pine/docs/blob/main/public/demo.md).

### TLDR, What's the point
Quill OS' goal is to provide an experience for the PineNote which is:
- Refined, so special software written for eink, adjusted for eink
- Easy to use, without a external keyboard, just as a regular android eink tablet, but still advanced tiling for users who want it
- Recoverable in field: Linux users are tinkerers, things break because of us and without us, Quill OS should be recoverable to usable state without another machine.
- Reasonable security but hackable, home directory encryption by default for example, but still hackable, no limitations to what you do to it
- Easy to install/reproductible, even from scratch by compiling, everything automated
  - All the software written by the community for the pinenote (HRDL kernel, etc) is managed by us for you, no need for you to be a linux expert to install it and use it

### Current state
Usable for advanced users, but there are many major and minor issues to be solved.

### Install & Update
Keep in mind those are prototype guides:
- [Installing](https://github.com/PorQ-Pine/docs/blob/main/public/install_from_scratch.md)
- [Updating](https://github.com/PorQ-Pine/docs/blob/main/public/update_from_source.md)

### Technical overview / cool graph of the OS
Look into [technical/README.md](./technical/README.md)

### Who, what, when
So let's explain a bit what is what where and who when

There is old Quill OS (Formerly InkBox), here: 
- https://github.com/Quill-OS/quill

Which was almost fully created by [Nicolas](https://github.com/tux-linux) and [Szybet](https://github.com/Szybet) (and some contributors along the way)

That OS was killed by the manufacturer. This organisation, is named PorQ-Pine, so Port Quill to Pine(Note), the port is pretty much a lie, the only thing we ported was us, this is a complete rewrite, but we learned some things along the way, so:

(Also thanks to donators and Pine64 itself, for providing the hardware and thanks to the pine community for providing building blocks in software that this projects uses)

### Design principles
Because we learn from our mistakes, sometimes (And the Pinenote user target is different from Kobo devices)

(A bit of the same as the TLDR)

1. Rust.
2. It should be easily reproductible (so [quillstrap](https://github.com/PorQ-Pine/quillstrap/tree/main) exists)
3. Hackable but recoverable without needing another machine. These 2 points conflict with each other, usually, so balancing them is needed
4. Reasonable security (So home directory encryption by default, but don't conflict with point 3)
5. Choosing solutions which are easily maintanable and follow current standards of doing things (As in, not hacky solutions, old Quill was a bit spaghetti in the case of design)
